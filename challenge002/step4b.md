When we are working with Pods sometimes we need to check details of the pod for investigation purpose or verification. When we do that we can see many useful information like:
- Events related with pod
- Names of the pod and containers
- Names of the containers images
- Network configuration
and many many more. To do that we need to use this command:

```sh
kubectl describe object_kind object_name
```

>>Which image is used by our **latest** created Pod?<<
