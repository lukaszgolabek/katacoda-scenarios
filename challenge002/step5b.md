Our next command is related with Pod logs. Logs are generated by application which is running inside the container(s). They can help us with checking the application and in case any problem they help us answer the question: "What is going on with this app?". To do that we need to use this command:

```sh
kubectl logs pod_name -c container_name
```

>>Provide the log output from first container<<

=~= Hello, I am the first container nice to meet you.

>>Provide the log output from second container<<

=~= Hello, I am the younger container my name is second.
